The developed application combines two interesting fields that are meeting the pulse of time, recommendation systems and conversational interfaces. Concerning recommendations, the following projects can be seen as related as they also center on the recommendation of tourist data:
\begin{description}
\item \href{https://foursquare.com/}{Foursquare} a location-based recommender service which adapts to the user’s profile and returns venues given the user’s proximity. As already discussed, some elements of the Foursquare API are integrated into the presented chatbot. 
\item \href{https://www.tripadvisor.com/}{TripAdvisor} a user-based tourist website. TripAdvisor is mainly a project in which user share their experiences and rate points of interest. Since 2014, TripAdvisor provides hotel recommendations based on the user’s search history and feedback \cite{tripadvisor:recommender}. In this project, a TripAdvisor rating data set was used as a base for retrieving user ratings.

However, those examples present their results in a different way than the chatbot does. Of course, due to the recent hype of chatbots, there is a large variety of different chatbots for all possible kinds of platforms. In the following, some chatbots are presented that are similar to the one developed in this project:
\begin{description}
\item \href{https://www.hipmunk.com/tailwind/hello-hipmunk-bot-for-skype/}{Hipmunk} a Skype chatbot that gives travel advices and recommendations. Its focus is the recommendation of flights and hotels, which is a topic which is not covered in this project.
\item \href{https://hipstercatbot.com/)}{Mica, the Hipster Catbot}: This might be the most similar project to the one developed. The chatbot can be accessed through a variety of messengers, such as Telegram, Skype or Facebook. It provides tourist recommendations based on the user’s current location. However, this application seems to be not as complex as the one developed in this project as the recommendations are not adjusted to the user’s profile.
