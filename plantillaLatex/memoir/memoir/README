    Memoir is a flexible class for typesetting poetry, fiction, 
non-fiction and mathematical works as books, reports, articles or
manuscripts. Documents can use 9pt, 10pt, 11pt, 12pt, 14pt, or 17pt as the
normal fontsize and, if you have scalable fonts, 20pt, 25pt, 30pt, 36pt,
48pt, or 60pt sizes, or even larger. Many methods are provided to let 
you create your particular design. The class incorporates over 30 of the 
more popular packages.

    IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE ASK THEM ON TEX.STACKEXCHANGE.COM 
    (PLEASE USE THE MEMOIR TAG) OR ON THE COMP.TEXT.TEX NEWSGROUP, 
    OR BY EMAIL TO THE MAINTAINER. PLEASE ADD MEMOIR TO THE SUBJECT.

    PLEASE DON'T WRITE PETER DIRECTLY AS HE IS AWAY MORE OFTEN THAN
    NOT.

Lars Madsen <daleif@math.au.dk> has taking over the support for memoir.


   NOTE: If you are using the hyperref package dated earlier than 2006/11/15, 
use the memhfixc package after the hyperref package, e.g.,
...
\usepackage[...]{hyperref}
\usepackage{memhfixc}
...
Later versions of the hyperref package automatically load the memhfixc package.

    NOTE: The full User Manual (memman.pdf) is a large document of about
550 pages in total. You do not need to print all of it, especially if you 
already have an earlier edition. Roughly speaking, the main portions are:
o Frontmatter: Preface, Toc, Introduction, Terminology  ~  40 pages
o Mainmatter: 
    Class commands and environments, etc.               ~ 380 pages
o Appendices: (La)Tex programming, Errors and warnings  ~  40 pages
o Backmatter:
    Command glossary                                    ~  40 pages
    Bibliography, indexes                               ~  50 pages


Changed (2016/05/16)

o memoir v3.7f

-- Sidecaption placement in oneside docs did not work as
   advertised. Now left and inner will place it on the left side, and
   right and outer will place it on the right.
-- fixed sporious spaces in \createmark
-- added loading luatex85 under certain conditions
-- updated the embedded booktabs code so we are back aligned with
   latest booktabs version.


Changed (2015/07/08)

o memoir v3.7e

-- per request, memoir no longer auto load the etex package on newer
   kernels (as the 2015+ kernels auto allocate the extra registers)


Changed (2015/04/23)

o memoir v3.7d

-- \end@dblfloat code reversion now only happens if fixltx2e has a
   release date older than 2014/01/01. Newer versions of fixltx2e has
   no problems with memoir
-- added \feetatbottom. Use it to force footnotes to be added
   from the bottom up when in a \raggedbottom context. Has no effect
   under \flushbottom
-- \twocolumnfootnotes, \threecolumnfootnotes, \paragraphfootnotes now
   use \skip\footins<series>
-- added \setfootins, it will set \skip\footins and its minipage
   counterpart, plus the \...v@r versions used by e.g.,
   \twocolumnfootnotes 
-- fixed a bug in page styles whereby one could not apply rule
   prefixes to a copied style.
-- Fixed typo in manual about \newleadpage, 
   reported by Werner Grundlingh
-- updated our version of \@doclearpage to match fixltx2e v1.1s (which
   will also be in the next ltx kernel). This will change float
   placement in a twocolumn doc (for the better)


Changed (2015/03/05)

o memoir v3.7c

-- by request from LTX3, the \textsubscript definitions now only takes
   place if \textsubscript is not already defined
-- fixed interaction between memoir and fixltx2e, we delay our
   \baselinestretch adjustment, reported by Ulrike Fisher
-- provided \@textsuperscript instead of \newcommand, then fixltx2e
   can be loaded before \documentclass, reported by Ulrike Fischer
-- fixed typo in pagestyle message, reported by Werner Grundlingh 
-- fixed a few sporious	spaces
-- made changes to the article option (reported by Victor Ivrii):
   o it no longer sets \chaptername to be empty 
     (no idea why it did in the first place, certainly not a good idea
     when using babel)
   o under the article option, the headings page style now correctly
     removes the term 'Chapter'  
-- added a caveat about \tightlists vs. \small/\footnotesize
-- reimplemented the ell chapter style
-- various typos

Please note that there are still items on my TODO list that has not
yet been addressed. They will when time permits.



Changed (2013/05/30)

o memoir v3.7b

-- bugfix sidecontcaption

o memhfixc v1.17

-- bugfix sidecaption and sidecontcaption


Changed (2013/05/22)

o memoir v3.7

-- Emulated date for array package made to match the actual 
   package
-- When ever the caption package is loaded we now reset 
   \abovecaptionskip to 10pt and \belowcaptionskip to 0pt 
   as in the default classes
-- Typos in manual
-- Fixed bug in \subbottom[]{...}. If an empty argument is given, 
   we will automatically eat the space after the (a)-part
-- Fixed bug in \makeheadposition, the last two arguments was ignored, 
   now works as intended
-- Removed \thanksfootextra from manual
-- Factored the box part out of the various \<X>numberline macros
-- The \cftXfont can now end with a macro taking one argument, 
   say \MakeTextUppercase
-- Included a carbon copy of the textcase package by David Carlisle,
   thus the class now provide the \MakeTextUppercase and
   \MakeTextLowercase macros
-- Default casing macro for the header information is now
   \MakeTextUppercase  not \MakeUppercase 
-- A hook is provided into \part, \book and \chapter which is executed
   just before writing to the TOC. The hook is especially intended
   when using the hyperref package and the layout dictates upper or
   lower casing these titles in the TOC.
-- All use of \MakeUppercase and \MakeLowercase in page styles,
   chapter styles etc. have been changes into \MakeTextUppercase 
   and \MakeTextLowercase
-- Added a sniplet showcasing an approach to auto adjust the numwidths
   in the toc using calc and etoolbox
-- Added titlingpage* which does not reset the page counter after the
   env
-- Added \mempreaddchaptertotochook and \mempostaddchaptertotochook
   hooks, executed right before and right after \chapter writes to the
   .toc file. It can be used to create a simple \chaptertoc command,
   see sniplet appendix.
   Added similarly named hooks to \part and \book, plus 
   \mempreaddapppagetotochook and \mempostaddapppagetotochook added to 
   \appendixpage
-- Clarification about \maxtocdepth (turns out, it is not used in memoir),
   related to http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/97018/3929
-- Made sure \postchapterprecis include code such that the text after
   \chapterprecis is indented in the same manner as it would just
   after \chapter
-- Added a hook at the very end of \chapter, could be used to add a
   \clearpage or similar
-- Added a remark about trimmarks vs. synctex.
-- Fixed bug in \foottopagenote, now it works with \continuousnotenums
-- Section on the \pagenotecommand moved to the chapter about page notes
   (\footnote, \sidefootnote, \sidepar etc.)
-- documented \cftKformatpnumhook, which could be used to auto adjust pnumwidth
-- Added a hook enabling color change in the showlocs page style
-- Workaround for colors leaking into paragraph footnotes (a proper
   solution would involve fixing the color stack problem as in bigfoot)
-- Subfloat counter reset factored out into macros, requested by Axel
   Sommerfelt 
-- split \@makecaption into two, and inner (\@@makecaption) which
   handles the formatting, and an outer (\@makecaption) handling the
   space before and after 
-- longtable caption support, added only if the ltcaption package is
   not loaded (either directly or indirectly).
-- Added an autoadjustment feature for \marginparwidth (suggested by
   Steffen V. Petersen), thus unless the user has used \setmarginnotes
   a suitable choice for \marginparwidth is made.
   More of these auto adjusting macros may be added later.
-- rewritten how page notes are written to the .ent file
-- added hyperref support to page notes


o memhfixc v1.16

-- restore footnote comma separation, when hyperfootnotes option is
   active (default in current hyperref)
-- make sure \@starttoc behave like ours, when running under hyperref


Changed (2011/03/06)

o memoir v3.6j

-- fixed typo in trimmarks
-- changed \chapter (and chapter like titles), \section's, \part 
   and \book such that a non-zero \parskip no longer interfer
   with the title layout.
-- yet another fix for the reimplemented page notes. Now 'x    x' 
   only results in one line break not several.



Changed (2011/02/18)

o memoir v3.6i

-- fixes two problems, one in \addtonotes and implemented the float 
   inner adjustment in a different manner such that \setfloatlocation 
   works again


Changes (2011/02/13)

o memoir v3.6h

-- provided marginfigure and margintable environments modelled after 
   tufte latex (work in progress) including special justification macro 
   to force content flush against the textblock
-- copied the contents of the placeins package, though under a 
   different name (\FloatBlock) 
-- added \setfloatadjustment to allow users to globally add stuff to the 
   start of floats, e.g. make typeset floating tables using \small 
-- added the possibility to change the color of the head/foot rule in
   the pagestyle
-- reimplemented the page note construction. Note that the new
   implementation does not rely on the same macros as the old
   implementation 
-- Manual: checked and verified the links in the bibliography and made
   all the CTAN links active in the PDF version of the manual. 
-- \namesubappendices and \anonsubappendices never existed, 
   their real names are \namedsubappendices and \unnamedsubappendices, 
   fixed in the manual.
-- fixed bug in \pfbreak
-- added hook/wrapper such that packages like bidi can control the
   typesetting direction of the headers/footers 
-- added footer and header measuring, inspired by similar feature in 
   fancyhdr. Though we do not change, say, the \headheight we leave 
   this to the user and simply warn about it.
-- made sure that \footnote, \sidefootnote, \sidepar and \sidebar 
   use the same baseline stretch setting (note that for now \marginpar 
   is not covered) 
-- fixed a font problem inside \quarkmarks
-- subsequent pagenotes are now separated in the same manner af footnotes

o mem12.clo

-- changed \headheight to 14.5pt, to match the pattern used by 
   the other clo files.

o memhfixc.sty

-- now take care of using \printpagenoteshyperref to print back
   references for page notes using hyperlinks.



Changes (2010/09/19)

o memoir v3.6g

-- fixed a typo in the vplaces env
-- made \needspace work better with \section and friends
-- added \settypeoutlayoutunit such that users can choose in which 
   unit the layout list should be written to the log file. 
-- removed the \footnoteA--C commands from the manual, they have 
   never existed 
-- Added \OnehalfSpacing* and \DoubleSpacing* which will additionally 
   also make floats and  page notes have the same spacing. Macros to 
   explicitly set these values have also been added
-- made it more clear who the maintainer is 


Changes (2010/08/22)

o memoir v3.6f

-- fixed a typo in memoirs float handling which caused floats to
   become lost, this brings float handling back in line

Changes (2010/08/20)

o memoir v3.6e

-- changed \parnopar to make its changes inside a group
-- some clarifications in the manual

o Memhfixc v1.15

- fixed typo introduced in v1.14 
  (special thanks to Ian D. Leroux and meho_r on ctt for reporting this)





Earlier changes are noted at the end.

To  manually install the package:
o run: latex memoir.ins (which will generate memoir.cls, 
                         a set of mem*.clo files,
                         and basic.gst for MakeIndex glossary files)
  run: latex mempatch.ins (which will generate memhfixc.sty and mempatch.sty)			 
o Move memoir.cls, the mem*.clo files and any mem*.sty file to locations 
  where LaTeX will find them (typically in a local texmf tree at 
  /tex/latex/memoir) and refresh the file database. 
  See the FAQ on CTAN at help/uk-tex-faq
  or http://www.tug.ac.uk/faq for more information on this.

However, it is alway recommended that you update your LaTeX
installation, instead of attempting to manually install a Package or
Class. Nowadays both MikTeX and TeXLive based systems provide update
facilities. (Though, note that LaTeX provided by a Linux distribution
does not).

To read the commented source code
o run: (pdf)latex memoir.dtx
       For an index run: makeindex -s gind.ist memoir
o run: (pdf)latex memoir.dtx
o Print the result for a hardcopy of the documented code (which consists
  of nearly 500 pages)

To process memman.tex (if you really want to do this and not just use 
memman.pdf as supplied)
o Make sure you can use the memoir class and the alltt, fixltx2e,
  layouts, graphicx, comment, and url (and perhaps some more) packages.
o Make sure you have memman.ist, and memman.gst, they are a part of the 
  memoir documentation files

o Run: pdflatex trims-example.tex
o Run (pdf)latex twice on memman.tex
o For an index run: makeindex -s memman.ist memman
o For an index of first lines run: makeindex lines
o For a glossary run: makeindex -s memman.gst -o memman.gls memman.glo
o Run (pdf)latex twice more on memman.tex
o Print the manual
  
(it is preferable to use pdflatex as the graphics from 
trims-example.tex will otherwise be ignored)

-------------------------------------------------------------------


Changes (2010/07/01)

o Memoir v3.6d

-- added \precistocformat, default \noindent, thus the toc precis text 
   is no longer indented by default.
-- Fixed some typos in the manual and in the class
-- reorganized the manner by which we handle the memoir user
   manual. This enables us to add revision numbers and dates to the
   start of each chapter of the manual. Please note that these
   revision numbers do not appear if one attempts to compile
   memman.tex as it relies on a modified (and thus private) version of
   svn-multi and also relies on splitting memman.tex into separate
   files.
-- If the 'article' class option is in effect we now use the plain
   page style by default instead of headings. 

o Memhfixc v1.14

-- Brought memoir sections back in line with hyperref. Now a hyperlink 
   to a section should end up above the section title, instead of below. 


Changes (2010/04/19)

o Memoir v3.6

-- reversioned memoir to version 3.6. The version number was tending 
   towards the golden ratio, but apparently this numeric value is 
   not widely known.
-- fixed \marginparmargin{left} in twoside mode
-- fixed a race condition in memhfixc


Changes (2010/02/20)

o Memoir v1.618033988c 

-- fixed sporadic space in regular \footnote command


Changes (2010/02/17)

o Memoir v1.618033988b 

-- fixed typo that broke \feetbelowfloat

Changes (2010/02/16)

o Memoir v1.618033988 

-- changed internal toc handling, as not to open extra files if the 
   TOC is being used several times.
-- fixed bug in the emulation of ifpdf, ifxetex and ifluatex that 
   might cause memoir to crash in certain cases
-- added \clearmark and \clearplainmark to 'clear' mark commands when 
   defining specialised page styles
-- made \subcaptionref robust
-- added \letcountercounter and \unletcounter to let one counter act 
   as if it had another name
-- add possibility to have \footnote write in the margin by internally 
   use \marginpar	
-- added a separate bottom aligned side footnote feature
-- added consistent interface for \marginpar, \sidepar, \sidebar, 
   and \sidefootnote for specifying into which margin the note should go
-- added feature that makes it easier for the side writing macros to 
   determine whether they are on the left or right of the text. The 
   defaults for \sidepar and \sidebar have been changed such that their 
   text now comes out flush up against the text.
-- added appendix about the picture environment. Apparently there is no 
   extensive freely available information about this environment. There 
   is now. The chapter stems from an abandoned book project.
-- extended the pagestyle changing macros such that they now warn if 
   the page style does not exist or if the page style is an alias 
   (trying to change an alias might lead to odd results)
-- added tocvsec2 to list of emulated packages (left out by mistake)
-- some undocumented hooks have been added to the toc building macros,
   more about these later.


Changes (2009/11/17)

o Memoir v1.61803398c 

-- fixed typo that broke \flushbottom. Please note that this fix WILL 
   change existing documents, potentially changing page breaks.
-- fixed a problem that might cause the addition of trimmarks to shift 
   the output box a bit downward. Thanks to Heiko Oberdiek for the 
   analysis and fix
-- fixed a typo in an example in the manual
-- changed \tmarkml, \tmarkmr, \tmarktm and \tmarkbm to place markers 
   for the middle parts of the text. Earlier they did nothing and had 
   to be defined by the user. Now the user can simply define them to do 
   nothing if needed.
-- added visual example to the manual showing the four trim mark types
-- changed the madsen chapter style such that it now has a better 
   unnumbered look


Changes (2009/09/21)

o Memoir v1.61803398b 

-- fixed typo that broke \thanks


Changes (2009/09/10)

o Memoir v1.61803398 

-- fixed bug with the upquote package
-- added support for the bidi package
-- added a simple page style
-- added feature to \newlistof such that \KeepFromToc will locally change say 
   \tableofcontents into \tableofcontents*
-- Fixed bug, such that XeLaTeX will get the correct pages sizes


Changes (2009/08/23)

o Eighth edition of the User Manual covering memoir v1.61803398. 
  The design Part is now in a separate document, memdesign, which 
  should be available from CTAN in /info.


Changes (2009/07/24)

o Memoir v1.6180339h fixes minor typos in memoir.dtx and mempatch.dtx

Changes (2009/07/21)

o Memoir v1.6180339g fixes minor bugs in memoir and mempatch

Changes (2009/07/12)

o Memoir v1.6180339f fixes minor bugs and adds new commands

-- \begin{labelled}{name} A description list where \name is the labelling macro 
-- \twocoltocetc - the ToC and friends will be set in two columns
-- \onecoltocetc - the ToC and friends will be set in one column (the default)
-- \doccoltocetc - the ToC and friends will be set according the class column option
-- \frontmatter, \mainmatter and \backmatter have had their float counter change 
   factored out such that users may now change these

o Memoir now automatically loads the etex package

o The manual includes a chapter giving some historical backround related
  to typesetting and further information about fonts. There is a new 
  chapter describing an example implementation of a memoir-based package for 
  a US University thesis.

Changes (2009/02/06)

o Memoir v1.6180339d,e fixes a bug introduced by v1.6180339c

-- \makeheadwidth, \makerunningheadwidth and \makerunningfootwidth no longer 
   support the '+' syntax from the calc package.

-- under hyperref \nameref is now an alias for \titleref


Changes (2009/01/26)
o Memoir v1.6180339c released with minor bug fixes that could
  not be done via the patch file, plus some new functionality. The
  manual has NOT been updated and the changes are noted below.

-- New paper size options: `a0paper', `a1paper', `a2paper', `b0paper', 
   `b1paper', and `b2paper' for A0, A1, A2, B0,B1, and B2 size stock paper.

-- Macro \memoirpostopthook{} which is called after the options are
   processed but before anything else is done (like setting the page layout).
   As an example, you may define it as (before the \documentclass}
   command):
     \newcommand*{\memoirpostopthook}{%
       \setlength{\stockwidth}{<wid>}\setlength{\stockheight}{<ht>}}
     \documentclass[...]{memoir}
  to specify a stock paper size of <wid> by <ht> that is not provided by the 
  defined options.

-- New `portrait' option (default, the opposite of `landscape').

-- New command \setbinding{<length>} for a binding offset of <length>.

-- New commands: \setpagetm, \setpagetr, \setpagemr, \setpagebr, \setpagebm,
   \setpagecc to position a (smaller) page on a (larger) stock at the
   top-middle, top-right, middle-right, bottom-right, bottom-middle, and
   centered with respect to the stock.

   The macros are to be used instead of \settrimmedsize taking the
   same arguments.

-- New optional parameter in \makeheadwidth{<style>}[<footerwidth>]{<headerwidth>}
   to set the width of the <style>'s headers to <headerwidth> and the footers 
   to <headerwidth> or, if given, to <footerwidth>. The two widths can also
   be set individually using \makerunningheadwidth{<style>}{<length>}
   and similarly with \makerunningfootwidth. The lengths, if needed
   are stored in \styleheadrunwidth and \stylefootrunwidth.

-- New `showlocs' pagestyle, which is provided as an example of what can be
   done to show the positions of headers, footers, and the textblock (lines
   are drawn showing the header and footer vertical locations and a box is
   drawn around the text block. It is implemented by two zero-sized pictures:
   \framepichead which draws a line at the header location, and \framepictextfoot 
   which draws a frame around the textblock and a line at the footer location.
   Following the declaration \showheadfootlocoff the header/footer lines
   will not be drawn (\showheadfootlocon turns them on again), and following 
   the \showtextblocklocoff declaration the frame around the text block will 
   not be drawn (\showtextblocklocon turns it on again). If you want a box 
   around your text you could create your own pagestyle using \framepictextfoot
   and with the showlocs code as a starting point. 

-- New command \centerfloat is a version of \centering which centers a wide 
   float or other known width element with respect to the textblock. E.g.,
   \begin{table} \centerfloat \caption{A wide table} ... \end{table}

-- New command \sourceatright[<length>]{<short text>}. Use at the end of a
   paragraph to put <short text> flushright. If it is short enough it will
   go at the end of the last line preceded by at least <length> (default 2em)
   space, otherwise it is set (flushright) on the following line.

-- New macro \leftspringright{<lfrac>}{<rfrac>}{<ltext>}{<rtext>} sets
   <ltext> as a flushleft column, width <lfrac> of the textwidth, and <rtext> 
   as a flushright column, width <rfrac> of the textwidth, with 
   (1.0 - <lfrac> - <rfrac>) textwidth space between them. E.g.,
   \leftspringright{0.4}{0.5}{On the left}{Right stuff}

-- Following the declaration \linenottooshort[<length>] paragraphs will be set:
   As normal but the last line will not be shorter than <length> (default 4em)

-- Using \russianpar instead of \par to end a paragraph causes it to be set
   following Russian typographic rules

-- Using \lastlinerulefill instead of \par to end a paragraph will be 
   cause any short line to be filled with a rule (\lastlineparrule) up to 
   the righthand margin.

-- Following the declaration \leftcenterright paragraphs will be set:
   First line raggedright, the last line raggedleft, and the remainder 
   centered. If you use this shape, set \everypar{} afterwards.

-- Following the declaration \justlastraggedleft paragraphs will be set:
   All lines normal except the last is raggedleft.

-- Following the declaration \raggedrightthenleft paragraphs will be set:
   First line raggedright and remainder raggedleft.

-- If you use the above unusual paragraph shapes then using \\ to break
   a line may give a surprising result. If so, you could try instead
   \atcentercr (a memoir macro) or \break (a standard LaTeX macro) to see 
   if the result is any better for you. In addition, just in case, memoir
   stores the original definitions of \\ and \par as \memorigdbs and
   \memorigpar respectively.

-- \titleref have been extended with a \titleref*, which under
   hyperref will provide the title but no link. Without hyperref, it
   is the same as \titleref

-- added hooks around the internals used by sidecaption,
   sidecontcaption, sidenamedlegend and sidelegend. They do nothing by
   default but can be used for something like this

   \makeatletter
   \newenvironment{sidecaption*}{
     \renewcommand\@mem@scap@beforehook{\checkoddpage\ifoddpage\else\raggedleft\fi}
     \renewcommand\@mem@scap@afterhook{\par}
     \begin{sidecaption}}
     {\end{sidecaption}}
   \makeatother

   which, if the user has placed the sidecaption on the outside in an
   twosided layout, then the figure will automatically be pushed
   towards the spine margin.



Changes (2008/08/23)
o memhfixc v1.10 released to fix problem with tex4ht
o NO CHANGES TO ANYTHING ELSE

Changes (2008/08/07)
o Memoir v1.6180339a released to fix extraneous spaces in footnotes
o NO CHANGES TO ANYTHING ELSE

Changes (2008/07/23)
o Memoir v1.6180339 released to cater for non-compatible changes in
  the hyperref package. It is highly unlikely that I will make any future
  changes to memoir with respect to hyperref modifications, instead hyperref
  can cater for memoir if necessary. All patches from mempatch v5.1 are 
  folded in.
o Mempatch package v6.0 released.
o INSIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE MANUAL (corrected typo in Figure 8.1 caption,
  added two persons to the Acknowledgements)

Changes (2008/07/12)
o Mempatch package v5.1 released with bug fixes for \DisemulatePackage
  and spacing of Part titles in the ToC.
o There was a mismatch between the general version of memman.pdf and the
  tds version. These are now the same. I took the opportunity to fix
  some very minor typos (perhaps no more than half a dozen words) in the 
  User Manual (if you have a printed copy of the seventh edition, it's not 
  worth printing the update)
o NO CHANGES TO THE CLASS

Changes (2008/06/02)
o Memoir class v1.618033 released with bug fixes for \feetbelowfloat
  and sidebar layout for the larger font sizes.
o NO CHANGES TO THE USER MANUAL

Changes (2008/05/27)
o Memoir class v1.61803 released incorporating all patches and comments about 
  v1.61803 beta. Major extensions are extended, or arbitrary, document font 
  sizes and provision of several styles of section headings.
o User Manual (memman), edition 7 released incorporating the contents of the
  Addendum. The part on typography has been extended and a glossary of memoir's
  commands and environments has been added.
o New (empty) version of mempatch.sty.

    This will be the last release for a considerable period of time. After 25
years in the USA we are moving back to the UK where there are grandchildren.
The process will probably involve at least 6 months in LaTeX limbo.
My definition of `considerable period' may imply decades.

Changes (2008/04/25)
o Beta version of memoir v1.61803 released incorporating all patches. 
  No major comments received.
